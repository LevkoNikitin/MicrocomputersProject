# MicrocomputersProject
## Microcomputers course final project for fall 2021 semester. 

When it comes to FDM(FFF) printing a significant issue is the hygroscopic nature of all of the materials, there are some exceptions though. The goal of this project is to construct a device that aids in creating a controlled environment for the removal of the built up moisture within the thermoplastics used for FDM printing.

The guidlines for the final project requirements are the use of the ATmega328p microcontroller as the main cpu, and the use of Microchip Studio for firmware development. 


The oled display is driven by the following avr c oled library:
